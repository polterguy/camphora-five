
## Introduction

Your app contains at the very least one _"datagrid"_. This is a tabular view of your data, similar to how
it looks like in Excel. This datagrid allows you to page back and forth by clicking the arrows in its toolbar,
in addition to that you can filter and sort your data. To sort descending, simply click the same sorting
column button _twice_. Below is an example of how your app may look like. __Notice__, your app might have
different columns and fields in it than the screenshot below illustrates, but the general idea should be
similar.

### This is a stub!

__Notice to app developers__

This documentation is a _"stub"_, and intended for you to modify, after you have generated your app.
Exactly what type of documentation you want to include, depends upon your app's views. To embed a YouTube
video in your own documentation, you can simply include the link to the YouTube video directly in a
paragraph, as illustrated below.

__Notice also__

You don't have to distribute Camphora Five after you have generated your app, since the app is 100%
_"self contained"_, and does not contain any references to Camphora Five's main files at all. In fact,
if you don't want your users to mess with your app, avoiding distributing Camphora Five into production,
or to your customers, might be beneficial.

You can also make your app become the _"default app"_ for your Phosphorus Five installation, by setting
it to the default app in your web.config file's `p5.core.default-app` setting. If you do, make sure you
point this setting to your app's _"launch.hl"_ file. If you set your app as the default app in your
web.config, Phosphorus Five, and its desktop will be entirely _"hidden"_, and your installation will
solely show your app, making your distribution become 100% focused around _your_ app!

You can create as many Markdown and/or Hyperlambda documentation files as you wish. If you name these
documentation files prefixed with an integer `01 - ` (notice the spaces), this will automatically order
your documentation files.

The easiest way to start editing your app's documentation, is to simply view this help file in Hyper IDE,
for then to click the _"pencil"_ button.

When you want to distribute your app, you can do such a thing by for instance using _"Hyperbuild"_, which
you're given a direct download link to when you purchase a proprietary license for Phosphorus Five.

Have fun :)
