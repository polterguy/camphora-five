# Camphora Five - A CRUD app creator for Phosphorus Five

Camphora Five is a CRUD app generator for Phosphorus Five. It allows you to create simple CRUD apps, without
ever having done any previous coding at all. You simply declare which data columns your apps should have,
and the type of columns, for then to generate your app. The results becomes a nice CRUD app, with lots of
features, allowing you to Create, Read, Update and Delete data items from a MySQL database.

Above is an example of an app with one _"textarea"_ column type, and one _"checkbox"_ column type.

Your apps will have support for importing and exporting items in CSV file format, and there will be a real
MySQL database which your apps use to store their data. In the above screenshot, you can see how the _"textarea"_
column type, has support for both Markdown, in addition to **#hash-tags** for its text items. The latter allows
you to easily categorise your items as you see fit, using hash tags.
