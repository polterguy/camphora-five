## Introduction to Camphora Five

Camphora Five is a CRUD app generator and codebuilder, that allows you to create apps declaratively,
to collect and edit tabular datasets. Although it is very powerful, and allows you to create your own
views in Hyperlambda - It doesn't require you to know any programming to create basic CRUD apps.
In such a way, it arguably resembles Microsoft Excel or Access. Below is a screenshot of Camphora Five.

In the above screenshot, you can see the process of creating a sales per month statistical graph,
associated with a sales application, which allows you to keep track of sales done by your employees.

When you have _"generated"_ your app, you can Create, Read, Update, and Delete records from your database, hence
the acronym _"CRUD"_. In addition, Camphora Five apps allows you to export and import items from Excel, or other
systems, that somehow supports import and export of _"CSV"_ files. This makes Camphora Five a perfect fit for
creating your own web apps, from where you want to collect and edit your data.

Your apps can also be further customized after you have generated them, by simply editing your
app's codefiles using for instance Hyper IDE. Below is a screenshot of one of the example apps that
comes with Camphora Five out of the box, showing a number of sales pie chart, grouped by product names.

When you have created your apps, you can easily create, read, update, and delete records from your app.
Below is a screenshot of the process of creating a new record for the above sales application.

When you have created your app, you can easily sort and filter your data. Your data is persisted in
a MySQL relational database.
