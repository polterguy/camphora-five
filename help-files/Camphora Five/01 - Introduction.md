## Camphora Five introduction

Camphora Five is a CRUD app generator that allows you to create apps declaratively, to collect and edit lists
of information. Although it is very powerful, and allows you to create your own views in Hyperlambda - It doesn't
require you to know any programming to create basic CRUD apps. In such a way, it arguably resembles Microsoft Excel
or Access. Below is a screenshot of Camphora Five.

In the above screenshot, you can see an app which is called _"address-book"_, and that allows you to collect
and edit a person's name, address, and sex. The app itself would resemble the following once you've _"generated"_
it.

When you have _"generated"_ your app, you can Create, Read, Update and Delete records from your database, hence
the acronym _"CRUD"_. In addition, Camphora Five apps allows you to export and import items from Excel, or other
systems, that somehow supports CSV files. This makes Camphora Five a perfect fit for creating your own web apps,
from which you want to collect and edit your data, from where ever you are in the world. Below is an introductory
video to Camphora Five, and although the video is relatively dated, and illustrates Camphora from a very old version
of Phosphorus Five, it still illustrates the process of creating your own _"Address Book"_ type of app.
